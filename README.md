# MVCE-DynamicResizing

Serves as an MVCE for a stackoverflow question I was posting. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36112172/jung-how-to-place-arrowheads-correctly-with-dynamically-resizing-vertex-shapes

Start the app with <code>-d</code> and it will resize the vertices dynamically.

Start the app with <code>-s</code> and the vertices will remain static sized.
